Stublishing API
===============

Stublishing API is a very simple reimplementation of [alphagov/publishing-api/](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/).

It's intended to allow you to run GOV.UK Publishing Platform applications without needing to run the entire stack of microservices.

Stublishing API tries to stay as simple as possible. Dependencies outside the standard library should be avoided wherever possible.
